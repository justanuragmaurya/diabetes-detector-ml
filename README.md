# Diabetes Detector ML

A machine learning powered application for detecting diabetes based on patient data. This project leverages various data science techniques to train, evaluate, and deploy models that predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Multiple machine learning models for classification
- Model evaluation and comparison
- User-friendly prediction interface (CLI or Web, if applicable)
- Modular, easy-to-extend code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justanuragmaurya/diabetes-detector-ml.git
   cd diabetes-detector-ml
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Adjust file paths in notebooks or scripts if necessary.

2. **Training Models:**
   - Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to explore data and train models.
   - Alternatively, use scripts in `src/` for command-line training and evaluation.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using built-in metrics and visualizations.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the provided scripts or interface to make predictions on new data.
